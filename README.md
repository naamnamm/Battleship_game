## Summary

My first C# application! 

I enjoyed coding in C# a lot. First off, with C#, by using namespaces, classes, data types, etc., my code is more organized and manageable. C# has definitely helped me to be a better programmer.
Also, I get to work through bugs and issues and figure things out by reading through the documentation and asking questions. 
I would say that Iâ€™m impressed with the documentation that Microsoft put together [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), it helped me understand the fundamentals tremendously.
