## Instructions/Game Flow
1) A ship with 5-unit long is randomly placed on the 10x10 game grid.
2) The user has 10 lives to guess where a ship is.
3) If the ship is hit, "X" will appear on the grid. Otherwise, "O" will appear.
4) If the user has sunk all the 5 units of the ship, user wins. Otherwise game over.

## Summary

My first C# application! 

I enjoyed coding in C# a lot. First off, with C# classes, data types, etc., my code is more organized, readable and manageable. C# has definitely helped me to be a better programmer.
Also, I get to work through bugs and issues and figure things out by reading through the documentation and asking questions. 
I would say that Iâ€™m impressed with the documentation that Microsoft put together [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), it helped me understand the fundamentals tremendously.
